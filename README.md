# Analyzing and Visualizing Unpaid Labor

## Overview

This project addresses the pressing issue of unpaid labor, specifically focusing on the gendered dimensions of domestic work, caregiving, food production, and volunteering. The COVID-19 pandemic has magnified the challenges faced by women in balancing paid and unpaid work. Despite decades of feminist advocacy, the unequal distribution of unpaid labor remains a significant barrier to achieving gender equality.

## Context and Problem

### Context

Unpaid labor includes essential tasks such as household chores and caregiving, which predominantly fall to women. The pandemic has highlighted the disproportionate burden of unpaid work shouldered by women, reflecting broader systemic gender inequalities. Women globally spend approximately 12 billion hours each day on unpaid work, contributing substantially to the economy while remaining undervalued.

### Problem

Unpaid work, including domestic chores and caregiving, is a crucial yet unrecognized component of global economic activity. Women spend significantly more time on these tasks compared to men, resulting in a double burden: managing both paid and unpaid work. This imbalance contributes to persistent gender inequalities in both personal and professional spheres.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to shed light on the origins of unpaid labor disparities rooted in gender norms and to highlight their pervasive impact on individuals and society. By exploring how these norms shape expectations and opportunities, we aim to inspire action and foster a more equitable society. This project seeks to challenge existing paradigms and advocate for meaningful changes in societal and economic structures.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to bridge the gap between complex data analysis and everyday understanding. We aim to make intricate statistics about unpaid labor accessible and relatable, transforming raw data into compelling narratives that highlight the urgency of addressing gender inequality.

## Audience

This project targets individuals with basic education and internet access, aiming to democratize data and make it relevant to everyday life. By engaging this audience through accessible storytelling, we seek to empower people with the knowledge to recognize and advocate for the importance of equitable distribution of unpaid work.

## Data

### Data Sources

The data used in this project is sourced from reputable organizations and covers various dimensions of unpaid labor:
- **Proportion of Time Spent on Unpaid Work:** World Bank ([Link](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.TIM.UWRK.FE))
- **Number of Informal Care Employees, Volunteers, Subsistence Food Producers:** International Labour Organization (ILO) ([Link](https://rshiny.ilo.org/dataexplorer14/?lang=en&id=FOW_T_VOL_SEX_VOL_NB_A))

### Data Collection

The data is collected from international surveys and government reports, ensuring a broad and representative sample. The datasets include information on domestic work, caregiving, food production, and volunteering across multiple countries.

## Data Quality

### Cleaning and Validation

Data cleaning involved:
- Removing countries with incomplete data.
- Eliminating unnecessary internal columns.
- Renaming and adjusting data types.

We used tools like Excel, Visual Basic, and Tableau Prep for data cleaning. The dataset was validated for accuracy, and additional variables were created to reveal trends and insights.

### Data Gaps and Bias

The dataset exhibits regional disparities and incomplete coverage for some countries. Despite these limitations, the primary data sources are reputable, and privacy and consent issues are appropriately managed.

## Data Analysis

### Analysis Techniques

The analysis was exploratory, aiming to pose questions rather than provide definitive answers. It included:
- Descriptive statistics on unpaid labor by sex, country, and region.
- Trend analysis to observe changes over time.

## Data Visualization

### Visualizations

Visualizations are categorized to provide:
1) An overview of global unpaid work
2) Trends in informal care work
3) Trends in subsistence food production 
4) Additional insights on volunteering and care work
5) Global Breakdown: How Many Hours Women Truly Have in Their Day
6) Mapping the distributing of unpaid work between sexes

Interactive elements allow users to explore data, with future plans to include accessibility features such as ALT text for visually impaired users.

## Process

Visualizations 1-5 were developed on tableau, while  5 and 6 were developed using P5 and D3 respectively. 

## Conclusions

This project underscores the need for policy changes to reduce and redistribute unpaid work. Key actions include:
- Advocating for paid jobs in the care economy.
- Encouraging men to share care and domestic responsibilities.
- Addressing global data gaps and improving ethical data sourcing.

Integrating insights from data feminism, we highlight the importance of emotional and embodied experiences in data analysis to foster empathy and understanding in policymaking.
